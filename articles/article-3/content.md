Advocates for mental health reform argue that addressing the youth mental health crisis requires systemic changes. This includes increasing funding for school-based mental health services, expanding access to affordable therapy and counseling, and reducing the stigma associated with seeking help.

> "We need to create a culture where mental health is prioritized and young people feel supported in seeking help without fear of judgment," says Dr. Anna Lee, a child psychologist and mental health advocate.
